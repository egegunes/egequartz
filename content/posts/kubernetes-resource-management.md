I had the chance to listen to [Bekir Doğan’s
presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss6p7pjnd1U), a former Kartaca
employee, at an event in 2017. I was very impressed when I heard that they set
up and distribute all the services they manage with
[OpenVZ](https://openvz.org/) in containers in
2005. Was anyone really into this type of thing?

Apparently, yes. Since the early 2000s, most of the industry and the Linux
community have been trying to make containers into what they are today. In
particular, Google has been a pioneer in making containers mainstream with its
contributions. You might have thought of Kubernetes right away, but this time
I’m talking about [cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) technology.

## A brief introduction to cgroups

It is easy to mistake a container for the entire system’s sole owner since it
isolates a group of processes and runs on the same core with other containers
and applications instead of virtualizing the whole system. An aggressively
resource-consuming container can also destabilize the fellow containers, making
the system unstable.

To prevent this, we can allocate the entire system to a container using
virtualization, but this will waste resources most of the time. For example, in
[Borg’s design documents](https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/), maximum
utilization of resources is stated as one of the project’s main objectives.

At this point, cgroups comes into play.

Google engineers started developing cgroups in 2006, and it was included in
Linux 2.6.24 in 2008. It is a disruptive feature that shaped the ecosystem with
the domino effect it creates.

With the inclusion of the code in Linux, system administrators can group the
system’s processes/tasks and subject them to common constraints. Process
priorities and resource limits can be configured and included in the
accounting. Moreover, this kernel capability paved the way for software that
radically changed system management such as LXC and later Docker.

Here is a small cgroups demo for you:

<script id="asciicast-372532" src="https://asciinema.org/a/372532.js" async></script>

To summarize the demo;

1. We create a control group called `fibtest`.
2. Within the group we create, we run a small C application called `fibtest`. This
   application generates Fibonacci sequences continuously.
3. With systemd-cgtop, we monitor resource consumption in all groups in the
   system.
4. The real story starts here. Inside the group, we change two values:
   `cpu.cfs_period_us` and `cpu.cfs_quota_us`. While determining how many
   microseconds each CPU period will last (50000) with `cfs_period_us`, with
   `cfs_quota_us`, we determine the maximum number of microseconds the program can
   use in each period (1000). Long story short, we choke the program.
5. We take back the values, and `fibtest` breathes again.

You can also get the cgcreate and cgexec tools we used in the demo by
installing `cgroup-tools` in Ubuntu 18.04, and `libcgroup-tools` in Fedora 32.

## Kubernetes and cgroups

By default, system programs and containers run competitively on the machine
resources. The containers’ resource consumption can make the machine unstable
if no resources are allocated for system operations.

Kubernetes also provides resource isolation for system and user processes with
cgroups. A cgroup called kubepods is created on every machine (if it doesn’t
already exist). For the Kubernetes system and services, the cgroup is not
created automatically; system administrators need to reconfigure kubelet.


```yaml
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
systemReserved:
  cpu: 500m
  memory: 500M
kubeReserved:
  cpu: 500m
  memory: 500M
```

![Allocatable](/images/allocatable.png)

```yaml
$ kubectl describe node
...
Capacity:
  attachable-volumes-gce-pd:  127
  cpu:                        8
  ephemeral-storage:          47259264Ki
  hugepages-2Mi:              0
  memory:                     30879764Ki
  pods:                       110
Allocatable:
  attachable-volumes-gce-pd:  127
  cpu:                        7
  ephemeral-storage:          18858075679
  hugepages-2Mi:              0
  memory:                     29831188Ki
  pods:                       110
...
```

`Capacity` shows the total resources seen by Kubernetes in the machine, and
`Allocatable` shows the total resources allocated to user pods.

## Resource requests and limits

Two concepts immediately appear in Kubernetes resource management: resource
request and resource limit.

Resource request is taken into account by the scheduler for placing pods on
machines. As long as there is enough space in the resource allocated to the
user pods, the pod is assigned to a machine. Once the pod is assigned to a
machine, `kubelet` guarantees that the container can always use the requested
resource. “Pending” status means that the pod is waiting to be assigned. Every
pod’s lifecycle includes a “Pending” status; however, if a pod spends a long
time in this situation, it is useful to review its resource request. It
consists of the sum of the requests of the containers within the source request
of a pod.

It is crucial to define resource requests for each container to efficiently
benefit from user pods’ total resources. The scheduler checks whether the
machine’s available capacity is higher than the pods’ entire resource request
while assigning the pods. In practice, even if the pods in the machine consume
fewer resources than their request, if the sum of their requests is equal to
the available resources, no new pods are assigned to this machine. Because, as
I mentioned above, the source requested by the container is always guaranteed
by `kubelet`.

Resource limit is taken into account by `kubelet` to prevent a pod from consuming
all the system resources.

A container can consume more resources than it requests. However, if it
consumes more memory than its request and the machine runs low on memory, it
will be evicted.

What happens to a container that consumes more than its limit depends on the
respective resource:

* If the memory limit is exceeded, the container can be terminated and restarted if possible.
* If the CPU limit is exceeded, the container is not terminated; only the CPU usage is throttled.

In practice, the total resource request of all containers on the machine cannot
exceed the resource allocated to user pods; however, the sum of resource limits
may be well above the available resources.

The total resource limit can exceed the maximum resource limit, just as the
aircraft companies sell extra tickets and do overbooking. In this case, it will
be more important to allocate resources for the system and Kubernetes
processes, as I explained above.

## Namespace level resource management

If you use Kubernetes namespaces to separate your services or environments
(such as test, qa), you can set predefined resource requests and limits for
each namespace. Therefore you can use default values for each container without
configuring the resources separately.

For the default resource configuration, it is necessary to define a `LimitRange`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: qa-limitrange
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 512Mi
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 256Mi
    type: Container


$ kubectl describe limits
Name:       qa-limitrange
Namespace:  qa
Type        Resource  Min  Max  Default Request  Default Limit  Max Limit/Request Ratio
----        --------  ---  ---  ---------------  ------------- -----------------------
Container   cpu       -    -    500m             1              -
Container   memory    -    -    256Mi            512Mi          -
```

Since we are dealing with so many YAML files enough to experience minor crying
outbursts during the day, it is desirable to write four lines less in each
file. However, `LimitRange` does more than that. Especially in multi-tenant
Kubernetes clusters, we can define `LimitRange` to approve resource requests and
limits.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: dev-limitrange
spec:
  limits:
  - max:
      cpu: 2
      memory: 1Gi
    min:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 500Mi
    type: Container



$ kubectl describe limits
Name:       dev-limitrange
Namespace:  dev
Type        Resource  Min    Max  Default Request  Default Limit  Max Limit/Request Ratio
----        --------  ---    ---  ---------------  ------------- -----------------------
Container   cpu       500m   2    2                2              -
Container   memory    256Mi  1Gi  1Gi              1Gi            -
```

When we define `LimitRange` for a namespace, we create an admission controller,
enabling us to add any pod to the cluster after being approved in terms of
resource configuration before being accepted. Those who do not conform to the
`LimitRange` rules get rejected. This way, third parties, independent of the
system administrator, can install new pods without making other services
unstable.

Our control over namespace is not limited to this. We can also limit the total
resources of the namespace by defining a `ResourceQuota`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: qa-resourcequota
  namespace: qa
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: 8Gi
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 8Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: test-resourcequota
  namespace: test
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "1"
    requests.memory: 4Gi
    limits.cpu: "1"
    limits.memory: 4Gi
```

With the above configuration, we guarantee the following:

1. The total memory request and limit of pods in Namespace cannot exceed 8 GB for
qa and 4 GB for testing.
2. The total CPU request and limit of pods in Namespace cannot exceed 2 CPUs for
qa and 1 CPU for testing.

# QoS classes

The QoS (Quality of Service) classes belonging to pods are essential for both
scheduling and eviction. There are three classes of QoS we can use:

* **Guaranteed**: If the resource requests and limits of all containers within the
pod are equal.
* **Burstable**: Pod does not classify as Guaranteed and requests at least one
container resource.
* **BestEffort**: If no container in the pod has any resource requests or limits.

As you can see, these classes are assigned by Kubernetes based on pods’ source
configuration.

```
$ kubectl get pod <pod> -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container-1
    image: ...
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 1Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 512Mi
status:
  ...
  phase: Running
  qosClass: Burstable
```

## Eviction

Despite all the configurations I explained above, our machines’ resources may
run out, and the cluster may become unstable. In this case, `kubelet` will try to
recover resources quickly. If their efforts are futile, eviction process
begins.

For eviction, `kubelet` puts the pods in a row:

Those pods belonging to BestEffort or Burstable QoS classes, which use more
than request sources from pods, are ranked according to their priorities and
how much resources they consume out of their requests, and are evicted.
Guaranteed pods and Burstable pods that consume fewer resources than their
requests are evicted the last. As their name suggests, Guaranteed pods are
assured that they will be not be evicted due to other pods’ resource
consumption. However, if the resources allocated to the system or Kubernetes
start to run out, they can also be evicted, beginning with the lowest priority
pod.

Priority is a value that we can set with `PriorityClass`, again as Kubernetes
administrators. In order not to complicate this blog post further, I end it
here after sharing relevant documents.
